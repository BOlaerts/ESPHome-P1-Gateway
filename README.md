#ESPHome P1 Gateway
## Introduction
Minimal dummy proof design without SMD components based on the designs of Willem Aandewiel and Marcel Zuidwijk.
## Hardware
![Schematic](https://github.com/BOlaerts/ESPHome-P1-Gateway/blob/main/Pictures/Schematic.png)
## Software
For integration in Home Assistant, I prefer using ESPHome with the DSMR component. More details can be found on https://esphome.io/components/sensor/dsmr.html.

For a stand alone configuration, I prefer the software of Willem Aandewiel. Releases can be found on https://github.com/mrWheel/DSMRloggerAPI.
